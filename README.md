# 🧭 Project Overview

Welcome to the fascinating world of image processing with Python! In this project, we aim to showcase the various possibilities of image processing using Python's powerful libraries such as OpenCV, PIL, and scikit-image. The project includes basic to advanced techniques to read, manipulate, transform, and save images.

- `convert_grey.py`: A Python script that demonstrates basic image manipulation, such as converting an image to greyscale.
- `data/`: A directory containing sample data used in the Jupyter notebooks.
- `images/`: A directory storing sample images processed using the image processing techniques demonstrated in the project.
- `main.py`: The main entry point for the project, showcasing some basic image processing tasks.
- `models/`: A directory containing trained models for advanced image processing tasks.
- `notebooks/`: A collection of Jupyter notebooks that goes into detail on various image processing techniques, including array manipulations, image transformations, and more.
- `README.md`: This file, a brief documentation of the project, its setup, structure, and various components.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python packages for the project.

## 🗄️ Data

The project uses sample images from various sources, such as:

- [scikit-image sample images](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- Various open-source datasets

These images serve as examples to demonstrate the different image processing techniques used in the project.
